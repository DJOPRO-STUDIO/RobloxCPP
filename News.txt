DJ STUDIO has decided to stop the updates at September 6, 2023

So for now, The last Update available is the 2.0.0.0
 

Why we just stopped the Updates ?
- DJ STUDIO has stopped the Updates in September 6, 2023 because all of the file of the Software "RobloxC++" has been damaged .

So Why they damaged ?
- When DJ STUDIO he's preparing the 2.0.1.0 Update which is the LICENSE Update, suddenly , the Software has damaged all of the files.

So thanks for installing RobloxC++ but now 
 we can say that "RobloxC++ is dead"

Of course not, we are doing the maximum for correcting the problem of the files

if we can't the software he will be return to the design of the 1 generation of RobloxC++
